# Interface and Abstraction in Python

## 🔹 Why Use an Interface?
- **🔄 Scalability**: You can add new payment methods (like CryptoPayment) without modifying existing code.
- **🔧 Flexibility**: The `PaymentProcessor` class works with any payment method that follows the `IPaymentMethod` interface.
- **✅ Code Reusability**: The same logic applies to multiple payment types without code duplication.
- **📏 Enforcing Contract**: All payment methods must implement `process_payment` and `refund_payment`, ensuring consistency.

## 🛠 Example: Using Interface in Python

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Interface: Defines a common contract for all payment methods
class IPaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def refund_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        pass

# Concrete Class 1: Implements UPI Payment
class UPIPayment(IPaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, upi_id: str):
        self.upi_id = upi_id

    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Processing UPI payment of ₹{amount} via {self.upi_id}")
        return True

    def refund_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Refunding ₹{amount} to {self.upi_id}")
        return True

# Concrete Class 2: Implements Credit Card Payment
class CreditCardPayment(IPaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, card_number: str, card_holder: str):
        self.card_number = card_number
        self.card_holder = card_holder

    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Charging ₹{amount} to credit card {self.card_number} (Holder: {self.card_holder})")
        return True

    def refund_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Refunding ₹{amount} to credit card {self.card_number}")
        return True

# Concrete Class 3: Implements PayPal Payment
class PayPalPayment(IPaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, email: str):
        self.email = email

    def process_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Processing PayPal payment of ₹{amount} for {self.email}")
        return True

    def refund_payment(self, amount: float) -> bool:
        print(f"Refunding ₹{amount} to PayPal account {self.email}")
        return True

# Payment Processor: Uses the Interface to Accept Any Payment Type
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, payment_method: IPaymentMethod):
        self.payment_method = payment_method

    def make_payment(self, amount: float):
        if self.payment_method.process_payment(amount):
            print("Payment successful!")
        else:
            print("Payment failed!")

    def make_refund(self, amount: float):
        if self.payment_method.refund_payment(amount):
            print("Refund successful!")
        else:
            print("Refund failed!")

# -----------------
# ✅ Demonstrating the Usage
# -----------------

upi_payment = UPIPayment("user@upi")
card_payment = CreditCardPayment("1234-5678-9876-5432", "John Doe")
paypal_payment = PayPalPayment("john@example.com")

processor = PaymentProcessor(upi_payment)
processor.make_payment(1000.0)
processor.make_refund(500.0)

processor = PaymentProcessor(card_payment)
processor.make_payment(2500.0)
processor.make_refund(1000.0)

processor = PaymentProcessor(paypal_payment)
processor.make_payment(1500.0)
processor.make_refund(750.0)
```

## 🎯 **Difference Between Interface and Abstraction**
| Feature           | Interface | Abstraction |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Definition**   | A contract that enforces method implementation in child classes. | A way to hide implementation details and show only relevant functionality. |
| **Usage**        | Used when multiple classes should follow a common structure. | Used when we want to partially implement some methods but hide details. |
| **Implementation** | No implementation of methods, only method signatures. | Can have both abstract methods and concrete methods. |
| **Flexibility**  | Allows multiple different implementations to follow the same structure. | Helps in simplifying complex systems by exposing only essential details. |
| **Example**      | `IPaymentMethod` defines a structure but doesn't implement methods. | A base class `Shape` might have `area()` as an abstract method but implement `display()`. |

## ✅ **When to Use What?**
- Use **Interface** when you want to enforce a structure for different implementations (e.g., different payment methods).
- Use **Abstraction** when you want to provide a base implementation but leave some methods to be defined by subclasses (e.g., a `Shape` class where `area()` is abstract but `display()` is implemented).

### 🚀 **Final Thought:**
**Interfaces** define "what should be done" but not "how", whereas **Abstraction** defines "what should be done" and partially "how" it should be done. Use them wisely to achieve a scalable and maintainable codebase!

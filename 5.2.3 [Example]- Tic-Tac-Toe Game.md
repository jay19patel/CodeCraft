# **Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation**

## **Introduction**

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a **3x3 grid**. Players take turns marking a square with either **'X'** or **'O'**. The first player to align three marks **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** wins the game.

## **Game Representation**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Representation of the Board**
```
  1 | 2 | 3 
 ---+---+---
  4 | 5 | 6 
 ---+---+---
  7 | 8 | 9 
```
Each number represents a position where a player can place their mark.

---

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Create the Board**
- Use a **list of 9 elements** to represent the board.
- Initially, all positions are empty (`' '`).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Player Moves**
- Players **'X'** and **'O'** take turns.
- Validate the input to ensure a position is **not already occupied**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Check for a Win**
- A player wins if any of the following conditions are met:
  - **Horizontal Win** ‚Üí `board[0] == board[1] == board[2] != ' '` (same for rows 2 and 3)
  - **Vertical Win** ‚Üí `board[0] == board[3] == board[6] != ' '` (same for columns 2 and 3)
  - **Diagonal Win** ‚Üí `board[0] == board[4] == board[8] != ' '` or `board[2] == board[4] == board[6] != ' '`.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Step 4: Check for a Draw**
- If **all** positions are filled and no player has won, the game is a **draw**.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Step 5: Loop Until Game Ends**
- Players keep taking turns until there is a **winner or a draw**.

## **Time Complexity Analysis**

| Method            | Time Complexity | Explanation                        |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `make_move()`    | **O(1)**        | Updates a single position         |
| `check_winner()` | **O(1)**        | Fixed number of checks (8 cases)  |
| `check_draw()`   | **O(n)**        | Scans all 9 positions             |
| `play()`         | **O(n)**        | Maximum 9 moves in a full game    |

## **Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **Simple Grid-Based Logic**: Uses a **list** to represent the board.  
‚úÖ **Turn-Based System**: Players switch after each valid move.  
‚úÖ **Optimized Win Check**: Uses **predefined winning positions** to speed up checks.  
‚úÖ **Interactive Play**: Uses input handling for a real-game experience.

## **Conclusion**

Tic-Tac-Toe is an excellent beginner project to practice **data structures, loops, and conditionals** in Python. This implementation is optimized for efficiency and can be further expanded with AI-based move prediction. üöÄ

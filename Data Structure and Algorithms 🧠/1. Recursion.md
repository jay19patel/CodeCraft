# Recursion

## 1. Introduction and Definition
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. Each recursive call must move closer to a base case to prevent infinite recursion.

Key concepts:
- Base case: The condition that stops recursion
- Recursive case: The part where the function calls itself
- Call stack: The stack of function calls
- Stack overflow: When recursion goes too deep

## 2. Why and When to Use
Recursion is useful when:
- Problem can be broken down into similar subproblems
- Solution involves tree-like structures
- Working with nested data structures
- Implementing backtracking algorithms
- Solving mathematical problems
- Processing hierarchical data

## 3. Key Characteristics
- Function calls itself
- Must have a base case
- Each call moves toward base case
- Uses call stack
- Can be memory intensive
- Often more elegant than iteration

## 4. Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation | Time Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Factorial | O(n) | Calculate n! |
| Fibonacci | O(2^n) | Calculate nth Fibonacci number |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | Search in sorted array |
| Tree Traversal | O(n) | Visit all nodes |
| Tower of Hanoi | O(2^n) | Move n disks |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | Sort array |

## 5. Implementation Details

### Basic Recursive Function
```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

### Fibonacci with Memoization
```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

## 6. Real-world Applications
- File system traversal
- Tree and graph algorithms
- Mathematical calculations
- Game development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Compiler design
- Natural language processing
- Image processing

## 7. Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Tower of Hanoi
```python
def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Move disk 1 from {source} to {target}")
        return
    
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, target, auxiliary)
    print(f"Move disk {n} from {source} to {target}")
    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, target)
```

### Problem 2: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1
    
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        return binary_search(arr, target, left, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
```

## 8. Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Clean and elegant code
- Natural for certain problems
- Easy to understand for mathematical problems
- Good for tree/graph traversal
- Simplifies complex problems

### Disadvantages
- Can be memory intensive
- Risk of stack overflow
- May be slower than iteration
- Hard to debug
- Not suitable for all problems

## 9. Code Examples

### Advanced Recursive Functions
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

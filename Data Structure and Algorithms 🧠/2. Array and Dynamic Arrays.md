# Arrays and Dynamic Arrays

## 1. Introduction and Definition
An Array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements can be accessed directly by using an index. A Dynamic Array (also known as a resizable array) is an array that can grow or shrink in size as needed.

## 2. Why and When to Use
Arrays are particularly useful when:
- You need random access to elements
- You know the size of data in advance
- You need to store similar types of data
- You want to implement other data structures
- You need cache-friendly data access

Dynamic Arrays are useful when:
- The size of data is not known in advance
- You need flexible storage that can grow
- You want to maintain random access capability
- You need to implement dynamic data structures

## 3. Key Characteristics
- Contiguous memory allocation
- Fixed size (for static arrays)
- Random access capability
- Index-based access
- Cache-friendly
- Homogeneous data storage

## 4. Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation | Time Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Access | O(1) | Access element by index |
| Search | O(n) | Find element by value |
| Insertion at end | O(1) | Add element at the end |
| Insertion at beginning | O(n) | Add element at the start |
| Insertion at middle | O(n) | Add element at specific position |
| Deletion at end | O(1) | Remove last element |
| Deletion at beginning | O(n) | Remove first element |
| Deletion at middle | O(n) | Remove element from specific position |

## 5. Implementation Details

### Static Array
```python
# Static array in Python (using list)
static_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Dynamic Array
```python
class DynamicArray:
    def __init__(self):
        self.array = []
        self.size = 0
        self.capacity = 1

    def resize(self, new_capacity):
        new_array = [None] * new_capacity
        for i in range(self.size):
            new_array[i] = self.array[i]
        self.array = new_array
        self.capacity = new_capacity

    def append(self, element):
        if self.size == self.capacity:
            self.resize(2 * self.capacity)
        self.array[self.size] = element
        self.size += 1
```

## 6. Real-world Applications
- Database records
- Image processing
- Game development
- Matrix operations
- Buffer management
- Cache implementation
- String manipulation
- Sorting algorithms

## 7. Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Find Maximum Subarray Sum
```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_so_far = max_ending_here = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])
        if max_ending_here > max_so_far:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
    return max_so_far
```

### Problem 2: Rotate Array
```python
def rotate_array(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n
    arr[:] = arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]
    return arr
```

## 8. Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Fast random access
- Better cache performance
- Simple to implement
- Memory efficient for fixed-size data
- Easy to traverse

### Disadvantages
- Fixed size (for static arrays)
- Insertion/deletion is expensive
- Wastage of memory if elements are less than declared size
- Costly resizing operations for dynamic arrays

## 9. Code Examples

### Basic Array Operations
```python
class Array:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.array = [None] * size

    def insert(self, index, value):
        if 0 <= index < self.size:
            self.array[index] = value
            return True
        return False

    def get(self, index):
        if 0 <= index < self.size:
            return self.array[index]
        return None

    def delete(self, index):
        if 0 <= index < self.size:
            self.array[index] = None
            return True
        return False
```

# Linked Lists

## 1. Introduction and Definition
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each node contains:
- Data (the value stored)
- A pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence

## 2. Why and When to Use
Linked Lists are particularly useful when:
- You need dynamic memory allocation
- Frequent insertions and deletions are required
- The size of the data is not known in advance
- You want to avoid memory wastage
- You need to implement other data structures like stacks and queues

## 3. Key Characteristics
- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink during runtime)
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- Each node is connected to the next node through a pointer
- The last node points to NULL (indicating the end of the list)
- Memory efficient for dynamic data

## 4. Operations and Time Complexities

| Operation | Time Complexity | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Insertion at beginning | O(1) | Add a new node at the start |
| Insertion at end | O(n) | Add a new node at the end |
| Insertion at middle | O(n) | Add a new node at a specific position |
| Deletion at beginning | O(1) | Remove the first node |
| Deletion at end | O(n) | Remove the last node |
| Deletion at middle | O(n) | Remove a node from a specific position |
| Search | O(n) | Find a node with given value |
| Access | O(n) | Access an element at given position |

## 5. Implementation Details

### Basic Node Structure
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

### Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List**
   - Each node has data and a pointer to the next node
   - Can only traverse forward

2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Each node has data and pointers to both next and previous nodes
   - Can traverse both forward and backward

3. **Circular Linked List**
   - Last node points back to the first node
   - Can be singly or doubly linked

## 6. Real-world Applications
- Music player playlist implementation
- Browser history (back/forward navigation)
- Undo/Redo functionality in text editors
- Implementation of stacks and queues
- Memory management in operating systems
- Hash table collision resolution

## 7. Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Reverse a Linked List
```python
def reverse_linked_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev
```

### Problem 2: Detect a Cycle
```python
def has_cycle(head):
    if not head:
        return False
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

## 8. Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Dynamic size
- Easy insertion and deletion
- No memory wastage
- Flexible memory allocation

### Disadvantages
- Random access not possible
- Extra memory for pointers
- Not cache-friendly
- More complex than arrays

## 9. Code Examples

### Basic Linked List Implementation
```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
    
    def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
    
    def display(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")
```
